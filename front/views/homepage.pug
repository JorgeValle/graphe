  p I'm a software developer, with a particular interest in JavaScript, web development, and machine learning.
  p A good place to keep up to date with what I'm doing is #[a(href='https://github.com/JorgeValle' ) my Github page], where I'm pretty active. Please note that not all my work is public; private work can be sent upon request.
  p If you're a developer and want to connect, you can always reach me on #[a(href='https://stackoverflow.com/users/3371677/jorge-valle' ) my Stack Overflow page].
  p Finally, #[a(href="/blog") reading my blog] is always a good way to check out where my mind is at.
