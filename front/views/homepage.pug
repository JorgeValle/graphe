    p I'm a front end developer with a particular interest and expertise in JavaScript and user interfaces. I love the marriage of form and function at the heart of user interface development.
    p Lately, I have also been diving into deep learning, and frameworks like TensorFlow. I've been studying a lot of linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and principal component analysis, and how these all relate to machine learning; I'm really looking forward to blogging more about this journey.
    p A good place to keep up to date with what I'm doing is #[a(href="https://github.com/JorgeValle", title="Where many of my applications live" ) my Github page], where a lot of my software lives. I can also be reached on #[a(href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3371677/jorge-valle", title="Where I ask and answer questions regarding software" ) my Stack Overflow page]. I'm mostly active on posts tagged with JavaScript and front end.
    p #[a(href="/blog", title="Posts focusing on JavaScript, deep learning, and web development") Reading my blog] is always a good way to check out where my mind is at. I write about what I know, but also about what I'm learning. As such my blog is the primary vehicle through which I figure things out.
    p If you'd like to reach out, you can do so directly at #[a(href="mailto:jorge.e.valle@gmail.com") jorge.e.valle@gmail.com].
    p Finally, here are a few projects I've been involved with over the last few years.
